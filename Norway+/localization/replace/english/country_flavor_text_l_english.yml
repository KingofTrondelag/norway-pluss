 NOR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "For 1000 years the mighty kingdom of Norway has stood there, trough stabile and turbilent times. From the unification under Harald Hårfagre, then the great era of Olav Trygvason, and later Olav den helliges time Norway become a great nation wich was influental in trade in the northern part of the continent. Later, when unholy blood vashed away the blood of the crown things become worse, and after the civil war era, time pased. Magnus Lagabøte took the throne and the nation, as the first of it's size in Europe, and one of the first in the world, got a nation wide law. The land law reformed many things and brought centralisation to the country, and inspired others to do the same. The years went by, and later, under the folish king, margrethe the first of denmark was amrried to the throne of Norway, and the king passed away. The nation was put under a personal union with the danes. Some years wnt by and then the same happend to the filthy sw*des, and on the island of kalmar, in southern sw*den, a document was signed. An agreement to establish a common realm for the three kingdoms to defend against outsiders. The Kalmar Union. It was meant as an equal union, but the truth was that denmark was the supreme commander with sw*den right behind them, and Norway, a country who was uninnterested in that didn't want to join. Two out of the nine diplomats signed the trety, but even tho we didn't want to join as a nation in a union with no power, the other two countries overwelming milletary might forced us into submission. An era of freedom was over. We had fallen, and for a long time to come before the Lord would free us once again. After 400 years of danish supression we gained independence after they and france lost the napoleotic wars. We were free. Withouth hesitation we made a constutution. A democracy was born. A nation for Norwegians, made by Norwegians, freed for Norwegians and blessed by the lord. But the prosperety didn't last long. As the swedish army come north after the battles in europe, they marched into Norway, our small and porly trained army didn't have a chance. Afraid for uprisings, the sw*dish king agreed that we could keep our constetution, but as the danes had said, we were now under an union. An union under the sw*des. Humuliated under the swedish rule, The Lord has blesed the Norwegian people and the kingdom. Can you lead them and reclaim their lost lands? After ceneteries of humuliation under the danes and the devilspawns can you once again become a great power and subjugate your lost siblings? In this world you have to quickly rearm your nation to once again rule the waves and controll the north. But in your jurney for glory the russian bear, the british hawk and the prussian tiger stands in your way. Overcome them and reclaim your glory for the restoration of the empire and make the language blessed by God the international language and remove the filthy beasts of the worthless people. Spread your glorius language, culture and religion to finally have given revange to the trators."

 DEN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "After the Napoleonic wars that lead to Napoleon losing, Denmark which was on the side of Napoleon in self defense against the evil Anglo-Saxons and the filthy sauerkraut got humiliated and lost their brothers in Norway. The Danish people are filled with a strong will to return their former glory and be the dominant power in the north again, but lack the knowlage and miletary and econemy. Now, the only way they see forward is indutrialising and use the monkeys of the south to eliminate the lower beings and aid the Norwegians in their world domination and restore the lost glory of the northerners. The Danes will rule the land and their brothers, the Norwegians navy will dominate the waves and crush every filty beast that try to supress the blessed people and lands."
